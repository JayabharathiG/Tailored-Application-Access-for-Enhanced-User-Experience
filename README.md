To design and implement a tailored access control system within GlobalTech Solutions' ServiceNow instance that provides employees with role-specific applications and modules, thereby reducing confusion and improving operational efficiency.


 
## Built with

basically , we have used SERVICENOW DEVELOPER platform in this project


## User Story:-
GlobalTech Solutions was facing challenges with their internal ServiceNow instance. Their employees from various departments needed specific applications and modules that were only relevant to their roles. However, the existing setup in ServiceNow provided a generic view to all users, leading to confusion and inefficiency.


## Pre-Requisites:-
Knowledge on Service Now Administration.

Knowledge on Applications & Modules.

## Skills used to solve the problem statement:-
Service Now Administration.

## CONCLUSION

1.	Successfully created a new table ("Service Request") with relevant columns (Name and Issue) in ServiceNow.
2.	Created new users and assigned roles to them for proper access and functionality.
3.	Established user groups and added members (e.g., Jai Prakash) to the appropriate groups.
4.	Defined new roles and assigned them to specific users to manage access control.
5.	Designed and implemented modules ("Create New" and "All") under the Service Request application, ensuring role-based visibility.
6.	Used the impersonation feature to verify the user access and ensure the availability of modules in the Service Request application.
